# auth0-react-typescript-asp-net-core

A boilerplate illustrating Auth0 usage with a React / TypeScript client and an ASP.Net Server.

## Getting Started

You'll need node, yarn and ASP.NET Core 2 installed.

To install the Client (`ClientApp`) dependencies use `yarn install`
To install the Server (`Web`) dependencies use `dotnet restore`

## Auth0 Setup



## Running in Production

Build the client app with `yarn build` in the `ClientApp` folder. Then, in the `Web` folder `dotnet run` and open your browser to http://localhost:5000

## Debugging

Run the client app using webpack-dev-server using `yarn start` in the `ClientApp` folder. Fire up VS Code in the root of the repo and hit F5 to debug the server.  Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000
